# High-Fidelity Prototype
### DH 150 Assignment 8 by Kimberly Jimenez

### Project Description 

UPLOADIT is a photo sharing, social media site that allows for more user control and accessibility to key features of the app. The purpose of the prototyping phase, from low to high fidelity, is to gauge what needs to be changed in the process according to feedback and observation. For example, I noted in the low-fidelity prototype reflection, the search bar on the Profile page was inaccessible because it required a user to pull the screen down. Thus, I decided to place it on the Profile page itself to make it automatically accessible, rather than manually accessible. Updating key features according to users, I believe, is important to the process of prototyping.

### Tasks Supported

Currently, the UPLOADIT high-fidelity prototype supports four tasks. The first: a Profile page with images categorized by years. The second: a search bar on Profile page to search for images by month and/or year. The third: an immediately accessible Likes page, with number of Likes and Likes pages displayed. The fourth: a video player with a play, pause, forward, rewind, and scrubber buttons as well as a time marker.
